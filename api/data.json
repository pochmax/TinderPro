We‚Äôre a small, but profitable and rapidly growing company and we are looking to make our next strategic hire to support and further accelerate our growth. <br><br>We put a ton of attention and hard work into our product, and we‚Äôve built the absolute best platform out there for home improvement contractors.&nbsp; Our customers love our software and the support they receive from us.&nbsp; Check out our reviews on <a href=\"https://www.capterra.com/p/164068/Builder-Prime/reviews/\">Capterra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/builderprime/reviews\">Facebook</a> to see what some of our customers are saying about us.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a full-time position that is almost 100% remote.&nbsp; The vast majority of our meetings, as well as your meetings with customers will be online.&nbsp; There may be some requirement for in-person meetings, but they will be infrequent and travel will be optional during the pandemic.</div><h1><strong>Why YOU Should Apply</strong></h1><div>This is a unique opportunity to work with a software startup company that is still at a relatively early stage.&nbsp; We are profitable, growing rapidly, and we have already secured funding to further accelerate our growth.&nbsp; It‚Äôs OK if you haven‚Äôt been in a position exactly like this before.&nbsp; In this position, you will learn what it takes to build a successful company and use that to grow in your role here, or start your own company in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>You will be working directly with our Director of Customer Success and Inbound Sales, as well as with me, the founder/developer.&nbsp; You will be able to influence and make real change, and see the results of those changes immediately.&nbsp; You will learn what it takes to build software that actually makes a huge difference in businesses and that people love to use every single day.</div><h1><strong>Responsibilities and Day-to-Day</strong></h1><div>Your number one priority in this role will be to help grow the company by converting inbound leads into paying customers.&nbsp; You will engage with prospects who have signed up for a free trial or requested a product demo, and show them how to be successful with the software so they continue on as paid subscribers. &nbsp;<br><br>While we do have a sales process and we will continue to evolve that process, we are not a hard sales organization.&nbsp; We know that we will provide the customer with exceptional return on their investment with us, and we just need to help them achieve that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>You will perform product demos and walkthroughs, help customers with setting up their own instance of the app, and train users to increase engagement with the various capabilities of the software.&nbsp; You will also have the primary responsibility for the relationship with that customer on an ongoing basis to ensure their continued success with the software.<br>&nbsp;<br>As you will be spending a significant portion of your time speaking with existing and prospective customers, you will be learning all about the problems they are facing and what is important to them.&nbsp; With this information in hand, we will work together on the product roadmap to prioritize new features and capabilities to be built into the system based on the direct feedback you are receiving.&nbsp; Despite our small team size, we build lightning fast with new features and updates rolling out constantly, so it will be fun to watch the evolution of the app, and to delight customers with the kind of speed that makes them feel like this was built just for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>You will have a great opportunity to learn about and contribute to many different areas of the business.&nbsp; In addition to engaging with customers and influencing product development, you will take on various side projects as a secondary responsibility based on your strengths and interests. &nbsp;<br><br>Through these side projects you will have the opportunity contribute to building out other systems and processes that will make your primary job easier, and ultimately help you be more successful in acquiring new customers and supporting existing ones.&nbsp; For example, you might:</div><ul><li>develop new onboarding workflows,&nbsp;</li><li>create new user guides and documentation,&nbsp;</li><li>enhance or create drip email campaigns and email copy to improve user engagement and conversion,</li><li>create video and written content for blogs and social media,&nbsp;</li><li>and more.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>Requirements</strong></h1><div>In this role, you will need to take complete ownership over your assigned leads and customers.&nbsp; You will be given all of the tools and support to be successful without being told what to do every step of the way.&nbsp; If this appeals to you, then this may be the perfect position for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are some other qualifications that would make this role a good fit for you:&nbsp;<br><br></div><blockquote>You have direct experience working at a home improvement company in an administrative, production, or sales role.&nbsp; We get pretty deep with our customers on helping them grow their businesses, so it really helps to understand how these kinds of companies should (or shouldn‚Äôt) operate.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>- OR -</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>You have at least 2 years of experience in a SaaS customer success and/or sales role.&nbsp;</blockquote><div><br><strong>Additionally:&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You have a reliable and fast internet connection.&nbsp;</li><li>You demonstrate friendliness and empathy when conversing with customers and other people, and can relate well to a variety of different people.&nbsp;</li><li>You are comfortable proclaiming that you are tech savvy.&nbsp; You don‚Äôt need to be a developer, but you should be able to learn how to use new software products quickly and deeply.&nbsp;</li><li>You love the idea of efficiency.&nbsp; You are constantly driving to make yourself more efficient, and the idea of making other people more efficient excites you.&nbsp;</li><li>You are able to articulate how technology solutions can improve lives and improve business.&nbsp;</li><li>You love to learn, and you love finding new ways to get things done better and faster.&nbsp;</li><li>You have excellent written and verbal communication.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We can‚Äôt wait to work with you and build something truly amazing!&nbsp;<br><br></div>",

This is an extraordinary opportunity for an experienced executive recruiter who loves building systems and processes to 100% own optimizing our entire hiring machine from A-Z.  Our entire leadership team will support you however you need as you will be the main growth catalyst to propel us toward our goal of becoming a billion-dollar brand by 2025.  We are a 100% remote global team of 200+ and have grown 300%+ in the last 3 years.</p>  <p><strong>Hello, my name is Jason Collett, Head of People for Metabolic, and I need your help.  </strong>For the last 11 years we've been systematically building different pieces of our<i> <em>MetabolicOS</em></i> - our ecosystem of offerings that empower people to optimize their metabolism to feel their best, look their best, perform their best and live longer.  We're now weaving these disparate elements together to create a unified experience that combines exercise, nutrition, habit change, supplements, coaching and community.  This ambitious goal requires we secure uniquely fantastic human capital, which is where you come in.</p>  <p><strong>What Does the Ideal Candidate Look Like?</strong></p>  <p>We are not seeking just any recruiter - we need a strong leader who has built talent acquisition teams before.  Someone who is steeped in the art and science of reading people, systemizing processes, and is a magnet for the high-performing, happy, humble, hungry people who define our culture.  You get a thrill flexing your \"sales muscle\" when you land a top talent as recruiter, flourish flexing your \"marketing muscle\" when activating an employer brand on company and 3rd-party websites and get energized while flexing your \"EQ muscle\" when coaching hiring managers on your optimized process.</p>  <p>You jump out of bed early with ideas on how to build a full cycle recruiting machine, backed by people, process and technology.  You are invigorated in this competitive market because you know you will win, finding the best candidate every time.  You have the wisdom and background to navigate and legally document our hiring practices consistently.  You have 10-12+ years' experience successfully recruiting top talent, building employer brands, and have goose bumps reading this description because every fiber of you wants to \"do it\" (hands on recruiting) while you \"build it\" (create the machine). </p>  <p>Just as importantly, you're extremely into health, wellness and/or fitness.  You love experimenting with new habits, realize how critically important having an optimized daily routine is and simply can't get enough of this stuff.  Perhaps you've had a health challenge that got you interested, or you've just always been highly passionate about health, wellness and fitness.  Either way, your eyes are lighting up at the possibility of aligning your personal passion with your professional superpower.</p>  <p>If you're getting that stars-aligned feeling of \"this feels like it is written just for me\", please read on.</p>  <p><strong>What are the Key Points?</strong></p>    <ul> <li> <strong>Compensation</strong>: $150k - $200k + Bonus</li> <li> <strong>Location</strong>: 100% Remote (virtual team of 200+ with no corporate office)</li> <li> <strong>Benefits</strong>: Health/Dental/Vision/Disability/Life + Matching 401k + Unlimited PTO</li> <li> <strong>Hours</strong>: 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EASTERN (to standardize our rhythms)</li> <li> <strong>Culture</strong>: Human-first with High-Performing, Happy &amp; Humble People (no jerks)</li> <li> <strong>Personality</strong>: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others</li> </ul>            <p><strong>What Will You Be Working On?</strong></p>  <ul> <li> <strong>Build Recruiting Machine</strong> - You'll optimize our recruiting machine, lead the screenings, optimize the ATS, refine our sourcing tactics, own the outsourced partnerships with headhunters and recruiters, orchestrate our job board networks and hire your own support team.</li> <li> <strong>Grow Employer Brand</strong> - You'll get to grow our employer brand from scratch, architecting our career and job posting pages internally, while working with external websites to activate our brand, bring it to life and show the world why Metabolic is a phenomenal place to work.</li> <li> <strong>Deliver Results</strong> - You'll deliver the top talent we need to really lean into our ambitious vision to make living healthy easier than living unhealthy.  It won't be easy, it's a tall order, but with your help, we'll chip away at it with the collective force of the amazing team you source.</li> </ul>      <p><strong>What's Our Culture Like?</strong></p>  <p>We're serious about high-performance, <strong>so our culture is built around deep work</strong> to allow uninterrupted time for the focus needed to deliver world-class performance.  We also focus on real collaboration and transparency to keep us all in alignment and keep office politics out.  These aren't just talking points - we've implemented specific policies, for example:</p>  <ul> <li>A standardized 8:30 to 5:00 p.m. ET schedule to protect your personal and family time</li> <li>No standing meetings before 1 p.m. ET to empower you with 4 hours of truly deep work to GSD</li> <li>Daily huddles and weekly check-ins to brainstorm, align on priorities and remove bottlenecks</li> <li>No meetings the first week of the month to gain momentum for the month ahead</li> </ul>        <p><strong>Who Are We and How Are We Different?</strong></p>  <p>Our mission is simple: make living healthy <i>easier</i> than living unhealthy.  We do that by empowering people to fix their own health with our metabolism-first approach and unified ecosystem that powers our <i><em>MetabolicOS</em></i>. <strong>3 things make us different than other brands in the health and wellness space:</strong></p>  <ul> <li> <strong>Metabolism-First </strong>- After 11 years of trial-and-error with 500k+ people, we've found optimizing your metabolism delivers the results you want:  feeling your best, looking your best, performing your best and living longer.  Your metabolism is your inner compass for health, but most people don't understand how to read it; once you do, it'll tell you exactly what to do to help you thrive. </li> <li> <strong>Individualized-Approach</strong> - Paleo may work great for one person's metabolism, Vegan for another, Keto for another, etc.  Everyone's different, so to achieve results that stick, those differences must be respected; if not, things will backfire.  That's why our approach is 100% customized to the individual - there is no perfect program to <i>find</i>, it must be <i>built </i>to support how that specific person's unique metabolism works.  This is where the usual one-size-fits-all solutions fail - they don't respect our very real individual differences. </li> <li> <strong>Integrated Ecosystem</strong> - It's simply too hard to live healthy - lots of great <i>individual</i> solutions, but nothing is <i>connected</i>.  We're left to stitch everything together, which is confusing.  We simplify everything with an <i>integrated</i> suite of the offerings you need to optimize your metabolism.  We started with nutrition, then exercise, then supplements, then coaching and are constantly pulling in new pieces of the health puzzle. </li> </ul>      <p>We power up this 3-pronged approach with our proprietary Metabolic Optimization System (<i><em>MetabolicOS</em></i>) that unites practitioner wisdom and scientific research with ML/AI to deliver a truly customized data-driven consumer experience that helps you dial in your metabolism at any stage of life.</p>  <p><strong>What's Our Past and Future?</strong></p>  <p>Our company may be a bit confusing at first glance because we built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more.  We market these all separately under different DTC websites.</p>  <p><strong>However, now everything's being centralized under our new brand, Metabolic.</strong>  We're launching our flagship e-comm website on Metabolic.com in Q2 and our digital product + e-comm app in Q3.  Normally, companies raise money, launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money later.  We did that in reverse - creating products that solve specific problems first to bootstrap, scaling that up to fund building out our team and infrastructure, and then retrofitting the brand on top.</p>  <p>#LI-DNI<br></p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul> <li> <strong>7-10 Years' Talent Acquisition Leadership</strong> - You've architected recruiting machines A-Z including building employer brands, constructing sourcing pipelines, optimizing ATSs, documenting processes, and leveraging networks through Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.</li> <li> <strong>Strong Executive Recruiter</strong> - You have a phenomenal executive presence that people are naturally attracted to, a refined communication and presentation skillset, deft salary negotiation ability, and fine-tuned charisma to comfortably represent the \"face\" of Metabolic</li> <li> <strong>Hands-on Skills and Desire</strong> - Not just comfortable but energized with the opportunity to both be extremely hands-on initially while you build out your team as you scale things up</li> <li> <strong>Engineering Mindset </strong>- You see everything as a system, can easily identify all of its moving parts, how they relate in logic, time, sequence and function and use that insight to constantly optimize by removing constraints and capitalizing on opportunities with people, process and tech</li> <li> <strong>Driven to Excellence</strong> - You've got an ownership mentality with an inner drive to excellence that other people who aren't built that way find disturbingly intense :-)</li> <li> <strong>Exceptional Communication Skills</strong> - You're a perceptive listener, quickly synthesize info and can formulate a methodical action plan that can be clearly articulated verbally and in writing</li> <li> <strong>Passion for Health, Fitness and Habits</strong> - An unquenchable thirst to improve your health and fitness with an intentional focus on constantly optimizing your daily habits and routines</li> </ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul> <li>Health Care Plan (Medical, Dental &amp; Vision)</li> <li>Retirement Plan (401k, IRA)</li> <li>Life Insurance (Basic, Voluntary &amp; AD&amp;D)</li> <li>Unlimited Paid Time Off (Vacation, Sick &amp; Public Holidays)</li> <li>Family Leave (Maternity, Paternity)</li> <li>Short Term &amp; Long Term Disability</li> <li>Training &amp; Development</li> <li>Work From Home</li> <li>Wellness Resources</li> </ul>",

Omnipresent does just that.<br></p><p>We are a customer-focused global employment services partner that can help companies grow their teams in 155 countries and territories around the world. How do we do that? Well, through our SaaS platform, OmniPlatform. We help companies (big or small) deal with the complexities involved with hiring global teams remotely, by managing employee onboarding through to offboarding, including legal and compliance, payroll, expenses, and health and benefits.</p><p>We also practice what we preach! We are a fully remote company which means we have no head office. Our team of more than 150 people is located in more than 35 countries and territories around the world. This means you can work from anywhere. We provide benefits and support in any global location just as we would for our clients and their remote teams. Our company has a flat structure which means accountability and taking initiative towards your everyday tasks that help further our ambitious company goals.</p><p>At a time when remote work is exploding, we're growing our team to help make global remote work a reality for people everywhere.</p><p><strong>More about Engineering at Omnipresent</strong></p><p>The engineering and product teams work very closely together to form empowered teams with shared KPIs, that include Subject Matter Experts from other departments in Omnipresent (when that makes sense). Each team decides how it works for itself, and teams have a mix of approaches that vary based on their preferences, the needs of their users and the specifics of the work they are doing. Engineers interact frequently with our internal customers, and occasionally with external ones, to understand what they need from the software, get their feedback on what is being built and work with them directly if something goes wrong.</p><p>We have maintained an emphasis on technical quality as we grow - ensuring that our software remains refactorable, and is refactored, as we build - so we can maintain a high pace of delivery over time. We have high levels of automated test coverage, a very fast release cycle, and consider refactoring part of the work. We are working on improving the availability of slack time in the team so we can deliver more \"quick win\" improvements to the product and technology.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Your role </strong><br></p><p>Omnipresent is looking for experienced <strong>Engineers</strong> to help bring our customer and internal facing OmniPlatform to life. We are solving an incredibly complex problem and need the customer interface to be beautiful and usable. This involves building both a highly performant frontend application and a mesh of backend services which abstract the complex country specific elements and surface the required data to the frontend.</p><ul><li>You would be joining a fast-growing distributed team of engineers, who work cross-functionally with Product and Design to build the OmniPlatform, solve problems and support the needs of our global customers.
